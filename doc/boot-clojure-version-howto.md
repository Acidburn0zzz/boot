# Boot / Clojure Version Howto

Boot has two separate componentsâ€“the boot executable and the clojure libraries
it depends on. The executable (or app) should not require updates very often.
The app is simply a thin shim used to load the supporting libraries dynamically
from a Maven repository. This provides a smooth and easy update procedure.

Since the boot build spec is itself a Clojure program, boot must already have a
version of Clojure loaded before the script can be evaluated. The version used
is, of course, configurable, as explained below.

## Update or Set Boot and Clojure Versions

To update the boot libraries to the latest stable release do this:

```
$ boot -u
```

The `DEV` update channel will install the latest testing version of the boot
libs:

```
$ BOOT_CHANNEL=DEV boot -u
```

You can also select the version via environment variables:

```
$ BOOT_VERSION=1.2.3 boot -V
```

The version of Clojure used can be set via environment variables, like this:

```
$ BOOT_CLOJURE_VERSION=1.7.0-alpha1 boot -u
```

This globally sets the version of clojure that boot will use. Note that this can
be used in combination with the other environment variables, too.

### Pinning a Project to a Specific Version

You can fix the version of boot used to build a project by creating a file
named `boot.properties` in the project directory. If such a file exists it will
be read and boot will load the versions specified. To pin a project to the
current clobal versions of boot and Clojure:

```
$ boot -V > boot.properties
```

This method also supports setting the versions via the environment, of course,
to override the current global versions.
