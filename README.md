# boot

Boot is a minimal Clojure program 'bootloader'.  It reads a
configuration map from a `boot.edn` file in the current directory
and starts a JVM with Clojure, dependencies, and directories
on the classpath. After the JVM is set up it runs a function
or evaluates an expression as specified in the configuration.

*This is experimental software and subject to frequent change.*

## Overview

While boot can be used for just running some Clojure function in a
JVM, it can also be the foundation for better project build tooling.
The idea is: instead of a pseudo-declarative project.clj file in
your Clojure project, multiple JVMs, plugins, etc., you simply use
boot to run a Clojure function which builds your project.

### Configuration

Boot maintains its state in a configuration atom initially
derived from the data in the `boot.edn` file. The configuration
can be modified at runtime to manipulate the application state,
i.e. add dependencies to the classpath, etc. An additional global
configuration file `~/.boot.edn` in the user's home directory may
contain configuration data which is to be included in all builds.

Options may be passed to the `java` command via the `JVM_OPTS`
environment variable.

### Middleware

Individual tasks within the build process are composed of middleware
(like [ring][1] does, for example).  Everything is implemented as
Clojure functions, so it's easy to customize the build process for
individual projects and to package these build processes for
distribution.

The task middleware is composed into an application at runtime
according to the command line options passed to boot. Individual
tasks may be passed arguments at this time, as well.

There is a selection of generally applicable middleware included in
the [boot.task][2] repository to do useful things like watch
directories for changed files, sync/copy files between directories,
etc. This is a good place to look for examples when building custom
tasks.

### Tasks

Boot tasks may also be specified as subconfigurations inside the
`boot.edn` file, and are similar to Leiningen's [profiles][3]. Multiple
subconfigurations may be specified. When invoked from the command line
the selected subconfiguration is merged into the current
configuration. Tasks can be used to call pre-packaged middleware
stacks, like a lightweight Leiningen plugin.

### Files

Since most build processes generate files at some point, boot
includes facilities for creating and managing temporary files
and directories. This temporary filesystem facility can be used
to have "auto-cleaning" builds&mdash;builds that don't need to have
a "clean" target because they don't create stale garbage.

There is also facility for collecting output files at the end of
the boot process and overlaying and syncing them to the final
project output directories. This eliminates the possibility of
stale output files while preserving the ability of individual
tasks to produce or delete output files without clobbering each
other.

## Install

To build and run boot your system must have:
* Java version 7+
* [Leiningen][4] version 2+
* GNU `make`

To build boot from source run the following commands in a terminal
in the boot repo directory (pre-made binaries will be made available
someday):

    $ make boot
    $ cp ./boot /somewhere/in/your/path/

## Usage

Check out the [example boot.edn][5] in this project.  It loads a Maven
dependency, adds a directory to the classpath, and specifies a
function to evaluate when the JVM is all set up.

    $ boot

Tasks are invoked by passing the name of the task key as the
first command line argument.

    # invoke the (built-in) :help task
    $ boot help

Multiple tasks can be invoked in a single build process, too.

    # invoke the :foo task and then the :bar task
    $ boot foo bar

If the task takes arguments it can be invoked by enclosing the
task name and arguments in square brackets.

    # invoke the (built-in) :help task with an argument
    $ boot [help foo]

Increase JVM heap space to 1G:

    $ JVM_OPTS="-Xmx1g -server" boot [foo {:bar 42}] baf [quux foop]

Note that the command line options are read in as Clojure forms, so you can
pass a map as an argument to a task, for example, as can be seen above.
