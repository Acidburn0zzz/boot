# Boot

Boot is a shell interpreter for scripts written in Clojure. It is designed to be
used with the “shebang” style of shell scripts to provide a simple means to have
single file, self-contained scripts in Clojure that can include dependencies and
so forth but don't need to be part of a project or uberjar. Also, boot is a
Clojure build tool.

## Overview

Boot consists of two parts: the boot **loader** (this project), and the boot
**core**.

* **The boot loader is a Clojure program in executable uberjar format.** The
  purpose of the loader is to add the boot core dependency to the classpath
  (fetching it from Clojars if necessary) and then hand off execution to the
  `-main` function defined there. The loader is designed to be as small, simple,
  and stable as possible, because updating to a new version is relatively
  awkward and it's important that scripts be runnable even if they were written
  for an older version of the API.

* **The boot core is a Maven dependency containing all of the actual boot
  logic.** Since it's loaded into the loader dynamically it can be updated
  easily, without requiring changes to the loader. The core version is specified
  in the script file to provide repeatability–scripts pull in everything they
  need to run, including the boot core itself. In addition to the machinery for
  interpreting Clojure scripts, the core also contains a number of features
  specific to boot's other role as a build tool for Clojure projects.

### Clojure Scripts

Boot scripts have three parts: the **shebang**, the **core version declaration**,
and a number of (optional) **top level forms**.

The shebang tells your shell to use the boot loader to interpret the script:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot
```

The core version declaration tells the boot loader which version of the boot
core to use:

```clojure
#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"
```

Any remaining forms in the script file are evaluated in the boot environment:

```clojure
(set-env! :dependencies '[[riddley "0.3.4"]])
(require '[clojure.string :refer [join]])

(defn -main [& args]
  (println (join " " ["hello," "world!"]))
  (System/exit 0))
```

## Getting Started

To build boot you will need:

* Java 1.6+
* [Leiningen][4] 2
* GNU Make

Build and install boot:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:tailrecursion/boot
$ cd boot
$ make boot
$ mv ./boot ~/bin/boot # or anywhere else in your $PATH
```

### Hello World

A simple example to get started:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot

#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"

(defn -main [& args]
  (println "hello, world!")
  (System/exit 0))
```

Write that to a file, say `build.boot`, set execute permissions on the file, and
run it in the terminal to enjoy a friendly greeting.

> Note: scripts interpreted by boot must have the `.boot` file extension.

### Script Dependencies

Scripts can add Maven repositories and/or dependencies at runtime using
`set-env!`:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot

#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"

(set-env!
  :repositories #{"http://me.com/maven-repo"}
  :dependencies '[[com.hello/foo "0.1.0"]])

(require '[com.hello.foo :as foo])

(defn -main [& args]
  (println (foo/do-stuff args))
  (System/exit 0))
```

## Boot Build Tool

In addition to interpreting scripts, boot also provides some facilities to help
build Clojure projects. Omitting the `-main` function definition puts boot into
build tool mode.

### A Minimal Build Script

Create a minimal `build.boot` file containing only the shebang and core version:

```
$ boot :strap > build.boot
```

The resulting file should contain something like this:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot

#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"
```

Then run it. You should see version and usage info and a list of available
tasks:

```
$ boot
tailrecursion/boot 1.0.0: http://github.com/tailrecursion/boot

Usage: boot OPTS task ...
       boot OPTS [task arg arg] ...
       boot OPTS [help task]

OPTS:  :v       Verbose exceptions (full cause trace).
       [:v n]   Cause trace limited to `n` elements each.

Tasks: debug      Print the value of a boot environment key.
       help       Print help and usage info for a task.
       lein       Run a leiningen task with a generated `project.clj`.
       repl       Launch nrepl in the project.
       syncdir    Copy/sync files between directories.
       uberboot   Build AOT compiled boot loader with all project deps included.
       watch      Watch `:src-paths` and call its continuation when files change.

Create a minimal boot script: `boot :strap > build.boot`
                                          
```

The tasks listed in the output are defined in the [core tasks namespace][5],
which is referred into the script namespace automatically. Any tasks defined or
referred into the script namespace will be displayed in the list of available
tasks printed by the default `help` task.

> Notice that when the boot script file is named `build.boot` and located is in
> the current directory you can call `boot` directly instead of executing the
> boot script file itself. This is more familiar to users of Leiningen or GNU
> Make, for example, and reinforces build repeatability by standardizing the
> build script filename and location in the project directory.

### A Simple Task

Let's create a task to print a friendly greeting to the terminal. Modify the
`build.boot` file to contain the following:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot

#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"

(deftask hello
  "Print a friendly greeting."
  [& [name]]
  (fn [continue]
    (fn [event]
      (printf "hello, %s!\n" (or name "world"))
      (continue event))))
```

Run it again to see the new task listed among the other available tasks:

```
$ boot
tailrecursion/boot 1.0.0: http://github.com/tailrecursion/boot

Usage: boot OPTS task ...
       boot OPTS [task arg arg] ...
       boot OPTS [help task]

OPTS:  :v       Verbose exceptions (full cause trace).
       [:v n]   Cause trace limited to `n` elements each.

Tasks: debug      Print the value of a boot environment key.
       hello      Print a friendly greeting.
       help       Print help and usage info for a task.
       lein       Run a leiningen task with a generated `project.clj`.
       repl       Launch nrepl in the project.
       syncdir    Copy/sync files between directories.
       uberboot   Build AOT compiled boot loader with all project deps included.
       watch      Watch `:src-paths` and call its continuation when files change.
                                          
Create a minimal boot script: `boot :strap > build.boot`
                                          
```

Now we can run the `hello` task:

```
$ boot hello
hello, world!
```

### Command Line Arguments To Tasks

An argument can be passed to the `hello` task like this:

```
$ boot \(hello :foo\)
hello, :foo!
```

The command line is read as Clojure forms, but task expressions can be enclosed
in square brackets (optionally) to avoid having to escape parens in the shell,
like this:

```
$ boot [hello :foo]
hello, :foo!
```

### Command Line Composition Of Tasks

Tasks can be composed on the command line by specifying them one after the other,
like this:

```
$ boot [hello :foo] [hello :bar]
hello, :foo!
hello, :bar!
```

Because tasks return middleware functions they can be composed uniformly, and
the product of the composition of two task middleware functions is itself a
task middleware function. The two instances of the `hello` task above are being
combined by boot something like this:

```clojure
;; [& args] command line argument list
("[hello" ":foo]" "[hello" ":bar]")
  ;; string/join with " " and read-string
  => ([hello :foo] [hello :bar])
  ;; convert top-level vectors to lists
  => ((hello :foo) (hello :bar))
  ;; compose with comp when more than one
  => (comp (hello :foo) (hello :bar))
```

This yields a middleware function that is called by boot to actually perform
the build process. The composition of middleware sets up the pipeline of tasks
that will participate in the build. The actual handler at the bottom of the
middleware stack is provided by Boot–it syncs artifacts between temporary
staging directories (more on these later) and output/target directories.

### Create New Task By Composition

Here we create a new named task in the project boot script by composing other
tasks. This is a quick way to fix options and simplify documenting the build
procedures. Tasks are functions that return middleware, and middleware are
functions that can be composed uniformly, so a task can compose other tasks the
same way as on the command line: with the `comp` function.

Modify the `build.boot` file such that it contains the following:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot

#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"

(deftask hello
  "Print a friendly greeting."
  [& [name]]
  (fn [continue]
    (fn [event]
      (printf "hello, %s!\n" (or name "world"))
      (continue event))))

(deftask hellos
  "Print two friendly greetings."
  []
  (comp (hello :foo) (hello :bar)))
```

Now run the new `hellos` task, which composes two instances of the `hello` task
with different arguments to the constructor:

```
$ boot hellos
hello, :foo!
hello, :bar!
```

### The Build Environment

The global build environment contains the project metadata. This includes things
like the project group and artifact ID, version string, dependencies, etc. The
environment is accessible throughout the build process via the `get-env` and
`set-env!` functions.

For example:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot

#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"

(set-env!
  :project      'com.me/my-project
  :version      "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description  "My Clojure project."
  :url          "http://me.com/projects/my-project"
  :license      {:name  "Eclipse Public License"
                 :url   "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies '[[tailrecursion/boot.task "2.0.0"]
                  [tailrecursion/hoplon    "5.0.0"]]
  :src-paths    #{"src"})

(deftask env-value
  "Print the value associated with `key` in the build environment."
  [key]
  (fn [continue]
    (fn [event]
      (prn (get-env key))
      (continue event))))
```

In the example above the environment is configured using `set-env!` and a task
is defined to print the environment value associated with a given key using
`get-env`. (This task is similar to the core `debug` task that is included in
boot already.) We can run the task like this:

```
$ boot [env-value :src-paths]
#{"src"}
```

### Tasks That Modify The Environment

Tasks defined in the `build.boot` script can dynamically modify the build
environment at runtime. That is, they can use `set-env!` to add dependencies or
directories to the classpath or otherwise update values in the build
environment. This makes it possible to define "profile" tasks that can be used
to modify the behavior of other tasks. These profile-type tasks can either
create a middleware function or simply return Clojure's `identity` to pass
control directly to the next task.

For example:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot

#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"

(set-env!
  :project      'com.me/my-project
  :version      "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description  "My Clojure project."
  :url          "http://me.com/projects/my-project"
  :license      {:name  "Eclipse Public License"
                 :url   "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies '[[tailrecursion/boot.task "2.0.0"]
                  [tailrecursion/hoplon    "5.0.0"]]
  :src-paths    #{"src"})

(deftask env-mod
  "Example profile-type task."
  []
  (set-env! :description "My TEST Clojure project.")
  identity)

(deftask env-value
  "Print the value associated with `key` in the build environment."
  [key]
  (fn [continue]
    (fn [event]
      (prn (get-env key))
      (continue event))))
```

Now, running this `build.boot` script produces the following:

```
$ boot [env-value :description]
"My Clojure project."
$ boot env-mod [env-value :description]
"My TEST Clojure project."
```

In the build script the `deftask` macro defines a function whose body is
compiled lazily at runtime when the function is called. This means that inside
a `deftask` you can add dependencies and require namespaces which will then
be available for use in the build script.

For example:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env boot

#tailrecursion.boot.core/version "2.0.0"

(set-env!
  :project      'com.me/my-project
  :version      "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description  "My Clojure project."
  :url          "http://me.com/projects/my-project"
  :license      {:name  "Eclipse Public License"
                 :url   "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :src-paths    #{"src"})

(deftask load-hoplon 
  "Example profile-type task."
  []
  (set-env!
    :dependencies '[[tailrecursion/boot.task "2.0.0"]
                    [tailrecursion/hoplon    "5.0.0"]])
  (require '[tailrecursion.hoplon.boot :as h])
  identity)
```

The `load-hoplon` task adds the dependencies needed for building a Hoplon
application and requires the hoplon boot task namespace, aliasing it to `h`
locally. To see the effect run the `build.boot` script with and without this
task and see how the list of available tasks changes.

First without the `load-hoplon` profile:

```
$ boot help
tailrecursion/boot 1.0.0: http://github.com/tailrecursion/boot

Usage: boot OPTS task ...
       boot OPTS [task arg arg] ...
       boot OPTS [help task]

OPTS:  :v       Verbose exceptions (full cause trace).
       [:v n]   Cause trace limited to `n` elements each.

Tasks: debug         Print the value of a boot environment key.
       help          Print help and usage info for a task.
       lein          Run a leiningen task with a generated `project.clj`.
       load-hoplon   Example profile-type task.
       repl          Launch nrepl in the project.
       syncdir       Copy/sync files between directories.
       uberboot      Build AOT compiled boot loader with all project deps included.
       watch         Watch `:src-paths` and call its continuation when files change.

Create a minimal boot script: `boot :strap > build.boot`
                                          
```

Then with the `load-hoplon` profile:

```
$ boot load-hoplon help
tailrecursion/boot 1.0.0: http://github.com/tailrecursion/boot

Usage: boot OPTS task ...
       boot OPTS [task arg arg] ...
       boot OPTS [help task]

OPTS:  :v       Verbose exceptions (full cause trace).
       [:v n]   Cause trace limited to `n` elements each.

Tasks: debug         Print the value of a boot environment key.
       help          Print help and usage info for a task.
       lein          Run a leiningen task with a generated `project.clj`.
       load-hoplon   Example profile-type task.
       repl          Launch nrepl in the project.
       syncdir       Copy/sync files between directories.
       uberboot      Build AOT compiled boot loader with all project deps included.
       watch         Watch `:src-paths` and call its continuation when files change.
       h/hoplon      Build Hoplon web application.
       h/html2cljs   Convert file from html syntax to cljs syntax.

Create a minimal boot script: `boot :strap > build.boot`
                                          
```

Notice how the second list includes `h/hoplon` and `h/html2cljs`, the two tasks
defined using `deftask` in the [Hoplon boot task namespace][6]. You could run
the `hoplon` task, for example, by doing

```
$ boot load-hoplon h/hoplon
```
