# boot

Boot is a minimal Clojure program 'bootloader'.  It reads a
specification map from a file `boot.clj` in the current directory
and sets up a JVM with Clojure, dependencies, and directories
on the classpath and runs a function as specified in this map.

## Boot-based Build Tools

While boot is useful for just running some Clojure function in
a JVM, it can also be used as the foundation for project build
tooling. The idea is: instead of a pseudo-declarative project.clj
file in your Clojure project, multiple JVMs, plugins, etc., you
simply use boot to run a Clojure function which builds your project.

Individual tasks within the build process can be composed as
middlewares (like [ring](https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring) does),
for example. This is much more powerful and straightforward than
the Leiningen plugin architecture. Everything is implemented as
Clojure functions, so it's easy to customize the build process
for individual projects and to package these build processes as
clojure namespaces for distribution.

Since most build processes generate files at some point, boot
includes facilities for creating and managing temporary files
and directories. This temporary filesystem facility can be used
to have "auto-cleaning" builds---builds that don't need to have
a "clean" target because they simply don't create stale garbage.

## Building and Installing Boot

You'll need a recent version of [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)
if you want to build boot yourself. Pre-made binaries will be
made available someday.

    $ make boot
    $ cp ./boot /somewhere/in/your/path/

## Using Boot

Check out the [example boot.clj](https://github.com/tailrecursion/boot/blob/master/boot.clj)
in this project.  It loads a Maven dependency, adds a directory
to the classpath, and specifies a function to evaluate when the
JVM is all set up.

    $ boot 1 2 3

You can test boot without installing it by running it via `lein run`
in this directory, e.g.:

    $ lein run 1 2 3
